# Proactive AI Assistant (PAA) - Complete Project Summary

> **🚨 CRITICAL**: This system uses **ANTHROPIC CLAUDE API EXCLUSIVELY** for all AI operations. **NO OpenAI APIs are used**. Vector embeddings use ChromaDB's built-in functions only.

## 🎯 Project Overview
A revolutionary Proactive AI Assistant built with advanced Hybrid Pipeline Architecture, featuring semantic search, structured AI responses, and proactive engagement. The system combines context-aware conversations with comprehensive habit tracking, people management, mood analytics, and intelligent commitment handling.

## 🏗️ Revolutionary Architecture

### Hybrid Pipeline Architecture (Phase 1 & 2 Complete)
The system now features a sophisticated 5-stage pipeline:

```
