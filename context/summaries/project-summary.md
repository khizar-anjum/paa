- **Frontend**: Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: LLM-based intent detection and natural language processing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM

## Core Features

### Unified Commitments System
- **Single Model**: Replaced separate habits and commitments with unified commitment system
- **Recurrence Support**: Handles one-time, daily, weekly, and monthly patterns
- **Completion Tracking**: Individual completion records with skip functionality
- **Time Management**: Optional due times for recurring commitments, deadlines for one-time

### Chat Interface
- **Natural Language Processing**: Create commitments through conversational interface
- **LLM Intent Detection**: Automatically understands user intentions and extracts commitment details
- **Multiple Chat Sessions**: Support for multiple concurrent conversations
- **Persistent History**: Chat conversations stored and retrievable

### Analytics & Insights
- **Completion Tracking**: Visual charts and statistics for commitment progress
- **Mood Tracking**: Daily mood check-ins with trend analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: completion rates, streaks, and patterns
- **Unified Dashboard**: Single view for all analytics across commitment types

### User Management
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- **Profile Management**: User profiles with customizable settings
- **Multi-user Support**: Isolated data per user account

## Key Components

### Backend Services
- **Commitment Management**: CRUD operations, completion tracking, recurrence handling
- **Chat Processing**: NLP-powered conversation handling and intent extraction
- **Analytics Engine**: Data aggregation and insights generation
- **User Authentication**: JWT token management and user sessions

### Frontend Components
- **Commitment Cards**: Unified display for all commitment types with context-aware actions
- **Creation Forms**: Dynamic forms adapting to commitment type (one-time vs recurring)
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive charts and statistics
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time conversation with the assistant

## Technical Highlights

### Database Design
- **Unified Schema**: Single commitments table handling all types
- **Completion Tracking**: Separate table for individual completion records
- **Flexible Recurrence**: JSON-based recurrence pattern storage
- **Migration Strategy**: Safe migration from habits to commitments system

### API Design
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Standard REST patterns for all resources
- **Filtering & Sorting**: Advanced query capabilities for commitments
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple records
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and validation

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-Based**: Modular React components with clear separation of concerns
- **State Management**: Local state with React hooks, no external state library needed
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for type safety

## Recent Major Changes

### Habits to Commitments Migration
- **Complete Replacement**: Removed habits system entirely, unified with commitments
- **Data Migration**: Safe migration script preserving all existing data
- **UI Transformation**: Updated all frontend components to handle unified system
- **API Consolidation**: Simplified API surface with single commitment endpoints

### Enhanced User Experience
