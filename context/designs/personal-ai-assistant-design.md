# Personal AI Assistant - Design Summary

## Overview
A proactive, persistent personal AI assistant designed for busy individuals who need intelligent reminders and life management support. The system leverages Claude Code as its core intelligence engine and integrates with various aspects of the user's life to provide contextual, timely assistance.

## Core Principles
- **Proactive Engagement**: The assistant doesn't wait for user prompts but actively reaches out based on patterns and scheduled events
- **Persistence**: Continues to follow up even when the user doesn't respond, understanding that busy people may not always have time to reply
- **Context-Aware**: Maintains deep understanding of user's life through multiple data sources
- **Privacy-First**: All personal data stored locally or in user-controlled environments

## Key Features

### 1. Proactive Reminder System
- Intelligent notification scheduling based on user patterns
- Escalating reminder strategies for unacknowledged items
- Context-sensitive timing (e.g., not during meetings)
- Natural language reminders that feel conversational

### 2. Comprehensive Life Integration

#### a. Relationships Database
- **Data Model**: 
  - Person profiles (name, relationship type, contact info)
  - Interaction history (meetings, conversations, shared experiences)
  - Emotional context (how user felt during interactions)
  - Obligations tracker (promises made, follow-ups needed)
- **Features**:
  - Automatic reminders for relationship maintenance
  - Pre-meeting briefings with relevant history
  - Post-interaction note capture

#### b. Calendar Integration
- Real-time sync with user's calendar systems (Google, Outlook, etc.)
- Meeting preparation reminders
- Travel time calculations and departure reminders
- Meeting context extraction for better assistance

#### c. Habits Management
- **Data Model**:
  - Habit definitions (activity, frequency, preferred times)
  - Completion tracking
  - Streak management
- **Features**:
  - Automatic habit reminders based on patterns
  - Gentle nudges for missed habits
  - Habit completion tracking without explicit user input
  - Adaptive scheduling based on user's actual behavior

#### d. Post-Meeting Check-ins
- Automatic check-ins after calendar events
- Emotional wellness monitoring
- Venting/journaling functionality
- Action item extraction from meeting notes

#### e. Intelligent Research Function
- Context-aware web search capabilities
- Personalized responses based on user profile
- Research history tracking
- Source credibility assessment

### 3. Conversational Interface
- Natural language processing for all interactions
- Multi-modal input (text, voice, quick actions)
- Adaptive communication style based on user preferences
- Conversation memory across sessions

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Core AI Engine**: Claude Code running as the primary intelligence layer
- **MCP Servers**: 
  - Calendar MCP Server (for calendar integrations)
  - Database MCP Server (for persistent storage)
  - Web Research MCP Server (for research capabilities)
  - Notification MCP Server (for proactive messaging)

### Data Layer
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data
  - Users table
  - Relationships table
  - Habits table
  - Interactions log
  - Reminders queue
- **Vector Database**: For semantic search and context retrieval
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for session management and quick access

### Integration Layer
- **Calendar APIs**: Google Calendar, Microsoft Graph API
- **Communication Channels**:
  - SMS/WhatsApp for mobile notifications
  - Email for detailed summaries
  - Desktop notifications for real-time alerts
  - Mobile app push notifications

### Frontend Applications
- **Web Dashboard**: React-based control center
- **Mobile App**: React Native for on-the-go access
- **CLI Tool**: For power users and quick interactions
- **Browser Extension**: For research assistance and quick capture

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Set up Claude Code backend

- Create database schema
- Build simple reminder system

### Phase 2: Basic Integrations (Weeks 5-8)
- Calendar integration (read-only)
- Basic habits tracking
- Simple notification system
- Web-based dashboard

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)
- Relationships database
- Post-meeting check-ins
- Research functionality
- Mobile app development

### Phase 4: Intelligence Enhancement (Weeks 13-16)
- Pattern recognition for habits
- Proactive suggestion engine
- Advanced natural language understanding
- Personalization algorithms

## Security & Privacy Considerations
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Local-first architecture with optional cloud sync
- User-controlled data retention policies
- Audit logs for all data access
- GDPR/CCPA compliance built-in

## Scalability Considerations
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling
- Message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for async processing
- Horizontal scaling for MCP servers
- CDN for static assets
- Database sharding strategy for user data

## Success Metrics
- User engagement rate (daily active usage)
- Reminder acknowledgment rate
- Habit completion improvement
- User satisfaction scores
- Response time for queries
- Accuracy of proactive suggestions

## Future Enhancements
- Voice assistant integration (Alexa, Google Assistant)
- Wearable device integration for health tracking
- Financial management integration
- Social media monitoring for relationship insights
- AI-powered goal setting and tracking
- Collaborative features for shared habits/goals
