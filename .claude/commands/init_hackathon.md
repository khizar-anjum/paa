# Hackathon MVP Initialization

## Project Context
You are helping develop an MVP for a **Personal AI Assistant (PAA)** that is **proactive and persistent**. This is being built for a hackathon setting with focus on rapid development and demo-ready functionality.

## Core Concept
The Personal AI Assistant is designed to:
- Proactively engage with users (not wait for prompts)
- Persist in following up even when users don't respond immediately
- Understand busy people need intelligent, contextual assistance
- Maintain deep understanding of user's life through habits, mood, and conversations

## Required Reading
Before proceeding with any development tasks, you MUST read these documents:

1. **context/designs/personal-ai-assistant-design.md** - Original comprehensive design vision
2. **context/designs/paa-hackathon-architecture.md** - Simplified MVP architecture for hackathon
3. **context/summaries/frontend-summary.md** - Complete frontend codebase overview
4. **context/summaries/backend-summary.md** - Complete backend codebase overview

## Implementation Guidance
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI backend + Next.js frontend + SQLite database
- **Deployment**: Local development setup (fastest for demo)
- **Time Constraint**: Built for 8-10 hour hackathon timeline
- **Focus Areas**: Authentication, Habits, AI Chat, Daily Check-ins, Analytics

## Implementation Plans
Detailed step-by-step plans exist in the `context/plans/` directory but should only be referenced when specifically requested by the user for implementation guidance.

## Key Features for MVP Demo
1. **User Authentication** - Simple login/register
2. **Habit Tracking** - Create, complete, track streaks
3. **AI Chat** - Context-aware conversations about habits/mood
4. **Daily Check-ins** - Mood tracking with 1-5 scale
5. **Analytics Dashboard** - Charts showing progress and insights

## Important Constraints
- **DO NOT** read any other files in the project beyond the specified design documents
- Focus on rapid development over perfect architecture
- Prioritize demo-worthy features that showcase the AI assistant concept
- Keep implementation simple but functional

Remember: This is an MVP to demonstrate the proactive, persistent AI assistant concept in a hackathon setting. Focus on working functionality over polish.
