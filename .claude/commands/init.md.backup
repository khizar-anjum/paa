# Initialize Project Context

This command initializes your understanding of the UW-AI-Waveform project by reading all relevant documentation.

## Instructions for Agent

When this command is invoked, you should:

1. **ONLY read files in context/summaries/** to gain:
   - Complete project understanding
   - Technical challenges being addressed
   - Team responsibilities
   - Getting started information
   - Project architecture and pipeline details
   - Module-specific documentation

2. **DO NOT read any other files** including:
   - README.md
   - CLAUDE.md
   - Any source code files
   - Configuration files
   - Any files outside context/summaries/

3. **After reading ONLY the summary files**, briefly confirm that you've:
   - Understood the project goals (neural video transmission for underwater acoustic channels)
   - Familiarized yourself with the two-part pipeline (training and evaluation)
   - Noted the key components and directory structure
   - Identified team member responsibilities (Khizar and Jason)
   - Reviewed all module summaries for comprehensive understanding

## IMPORTANT RESTRICTION

**You must ONLY read files from context/summaries/ during initialization.** All necessary project information has been carefully curated and placed in these summary files. Reading other files is unnecessary and may lead to information overload or confusion.

## Usage

Simply invoke this by asking the agent to "init" or "initialize project context".

## Purpose

This ensures any new agent working on the project has a complete understanding of:
- What we're building
- Why we're building it
- How the system is architected
- Who is responsible for what components
